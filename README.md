# Practice
In this repo I will upload the code that I was practicing.
Whatever I'm uploading in this repo, is my practicised code only. I might have used AI to help me; but most of the time, the code will be manually wriiten. 
If anyone wants to copy or use this code for practice purpose, they are free to use my code.
